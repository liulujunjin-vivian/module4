## Question and Answers:

#### Question Based on the cumulative return data and the visualization, do any of the four fund portfolios outperform the S&P 500 Index?     
  > No, there is not a single fund portfolios outperform the S&P 500 index

#### Question Based on the box plot visualization of just the four fund portfolios, which fund was the most volatile (with the greatest spread) and which was the least volatile (with the smallest spread)?    

  > BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC has the most volatile. TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC has the least volatile
